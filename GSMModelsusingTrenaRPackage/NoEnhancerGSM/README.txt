This was originally run in Pauls TRENAProjectPlacenta R Package.

This was run in July 2020, before we had updated Genehancer and was run without using genehancer regions.

We called this "BAD" because I originally ran this to test out the negative control models. However we also realized at this opoint in time that the code had added some manual thresholds that we needed to set to zero since we were performing by LASSO regression in holdout dataset.


Training data included ONLY MWH data, and was used to create scaffolding of TF/Target gene relationships.
